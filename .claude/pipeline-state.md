## Open items carried forward

- None currently. All Stage 1 clarifying questions were resolved (see
  `my-app/requirements.md` §2).

## Enforcement

Stage approval is now a technical gate, not just an instruction: see
`.claude/hooks/check-stage-approval.sh` (PreToolUse hook, wired in
`.claude/settings.json`) and `.claude/scripts/record-approval.sh`. Tested
2026-09-12: blocks unapproved writes (exit 2), allows exactly once after a
valid `record-approval.sh` call, re-blocks immediately after (single-use),
and passes through non-gated files/tools untouched.

## Notes for whoever/whatever picks this up next

- Requirements are locked (FR-1..FR-8, NFR-1..NFR-4). Architecture stage
  should design against those, not re-litigate scope.
- Repo push access: local commits succeed; pushing to
  `origin` (`https://github.com/SakshiGaba/ClaudeCapstone.git`) requires
  credentials not currently available in this environment — flag this to
  the human each time a stage commits, so they can push manually if needed.
